# Home Assistant Integration - Behavior Baseline

## Invariants

1. The coordinator MUST poll `PB.GetState` at the configured interval (default 5s)
2. Both FE0B and FE0C payloads MUST be decoded on every poll cycle
3. All sensor entities MUST update within 1 second of a coordinator refresh
4. Cloud sync failure MUST NOT block or delay local polling/entity updates
5. The config flow MUST validate grill connectivity before creating an entry
6. Temperature values of 0 MUST be reported as `None` (unavailable) to avoid false readings from disconnected probes
7. The climate entity MUST round temperature targets to 5F increments within the 180-600F range
8. HTTP timeouts MUST be enforced at 5 seconds to prevent blocking the HA event loop
9. The integration MUST gracefully report "unavailable" when the grill is unreachable

## Expected Behavior

- **Normal operation**: All sensors update every 5 seconds with decoded temperature and status values
- **Grill unreachable**: All entities show "unavailable" state; coordinator retries on next interval
- **Grill powered off (WiFi still on)**: RPC endpoints still respond; `module_is_on` = false, temperatures may be ambient or 0
- **Probe not inserted**: Probe temperature reads 0 → reported as None/unavailable
- **Cloud sync enabled**: JSON POSTed on every poll cycle; failures logged silently
- **Set temperature**: Command sent via `PB.SendMCUCommand`, coordinator refreshes immediately after
- **Light toggle**: Command sent, state reflects on next poll cycle

## Edge Cases

- MCU may return payloads shorter than expected during firmware boot; decoder returns None and coordinator reports UpdateFailed
- Multiple HA instances polling the same grill may cause ESP32 resource contention at very short intervals (<2s)
- Grill firmware 0.5.7+ requires time-based authentication; this integration only supports unauthenticated 0.2.3
